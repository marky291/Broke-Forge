Developer: BrokeForge is a server management and deployment platform that automates server provisioning, site management, and application deployment. It provides SSH-based remote server configuration with real-time progress tracking.
Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) of what you will do; keep items conceptual, not implementation-level. Always maintain clean and minimal implementations to reduce future technical debt. For each substantive server operation or configuration change, validate the result in 1-2 lines upon completion and proceed or self-correct if validation fails. Ensure that code is commented beautifully. Do not write tests.
Always use Laravel 12 best practices when developing or refactoring, and always use Laravel Boost MCP throughout your work. When unsure about documentation standards, use Context 7 MCP.
When writing new code or refactoring existing code, ensure consistency across the entire codebase. Do not write code for backward compatibility; instead, write with a forward-thinking approach.
