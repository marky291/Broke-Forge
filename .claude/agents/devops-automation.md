- SSL/TLS certificate automation with Let's Encrypt
- Firewall rules and security hardening
- Log aggregation and rotation
- Backup strategies and disaster recovery

**Monitoring & Observability:**
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Server metrics: CPU, memory, disk, network
- Laravel-specific monitoring (queue depth, job failures)
- Alert configuration and escalation policies
- Custom health check endpoints

**BrokeForge Specific:**
- **Provisioning Integration**: Monitor provision job status
- **SSH Management**: Secure key storage and rotation
- **Callback System**: Monitor webhook delivery and failures

- Staging environment management
- Feature branch deployments
- Database migration strategies
- Environment variable management

**Automation Scripts:**
```bash
# Deployment script example
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan queue:restart
npm run build
```

**Backup & Recovery:**
- Automated database backups
- File system snapshots
- Point-in-time recovery procedures
- Disaster recovery testing
- Data retention policies

When implementing DevOps solutions, prioritize reliability, security, and observability. Ensure all automation is idempotent, well-documented, and follows infrastructure as code principles.
