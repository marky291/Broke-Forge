 * Abstract Orchestrator Job Base Class
 *
 * Base class for orchestrator jobs that coordinate multiple sub-installer jobs.
 * Uses a separate lock key (orchestrator:{server_id}) to prevent concurrent
 * orchestrators while allowing child jobs to use their own locks (package:action:{server_id}).
 *
 * This separation prevents lock contention when orchestrators dispatch child jobs synchronously.
 *
 * Examples: NginxInstallerJob, ProvisionedSiteInstallerJob
 *
 * Child classes must implement their own handle() and failed() methods.
